        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> This page will take you through some basics of 
                html coding with the help of some friendly doggos.
                At the same time, we will learn some basic history and 
                information on doggo speak culture.

        <h1>Origin</h1>
            <h3><em>Doge to Doggo, the doge that started it all
                and the video that went viral. 
            </em> </h3>

            <p> In 2013 a picture posted by a Japanese Kindergarten teacher
                of her Shiba Inu named Kabosu turned into an internet sensation.
                The "mona-lisa"-esque, ambiguious facial expression of the dog
                seems to be the initial attraction. It sparked a global
                meme using comic-sans font and grammatically incorrect English. 
                Here we will learn how to embed an image in HTML.
            </p>

             </figure>

            <p> Some might say that what truly made the doge phenomena <em>take off</em>  
                (pun intended) was when "Doge Adventure" went viral on YouTube. With
                2.2 million views, "Doge Adventure" is a cartoon of Kobasu on an 
                adventure through the atmosphere. Here we will take a look at inserting
                this video into our index.html using iframe.  A two minute 
                version of video will follow.
            </p>

            <p>After the virility of "Doge Adventure" there was a lag before
                the dawn of the doggo. Doggo was most likely a term popularized
                by the Instagram account @WeRateDogs, but originally 
                hailes from the land down under. In Australia they like to short
                form or make up cute nicknames for pretty well everything, and 
                doggo seems to be part of the vernacular. One internet phrase 
                lead to another and now we have our own Doggo Speak.

    <section class="main-section" id="types">
        <h1>Types of Doggo</h1>
            <p> Since the dawn of doggo, there have been many new words created
                to describe different types of doggos. There are many, many different 
                words to describe different sorts and breeds of our four legged friends, but 
                for the purposes of this page we will stick to the most commonly
                used terms. We will use these various types of doggo to illustrate
                how to make lists in HTML. 

                First we will start with an unordered list of doggo terms that 
                refer to doggos by their general aesthetic and tempermant.
                <ul>
                    <li>Doggo - your average everyday dog</li>
                    <li>Pupper - doggo youth, the puppies</li>
                    <li>Borker - small but loud and proud</li>
                    <li>Floof - much fur everywhere</li>
                    <li>Woofer - lorge and loud</li>
                </ul>
            </p>   

            <p> Next we will look at an ordered list of doggo terms that typically 
                refer to specific breeds of doggos.
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Goldenboi - Golden Retriever</li>
                    <li>Longboi - Greyhound (or Russian wolfhounds)</li>
                    <li>Cloud - Samoyed</li>
                    <li>Puggerino - Pug</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="noises">
        <h1>Doggo Noises</h1>
            <p> Besides coming up with words to describe different types 
                of doggos, the internet has also come up with some words 
                that help us understand what kind of noise the doggo is 
                making. The most common of these are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Woof - common with lorgebois has a deep timbre</li>
                    <li>Bork - comes in all sizes, but often the smol doggos are known to bork</li>
                    <li>Awoo - almost exclusively with huskos but some other howlers too</li>
                    <li>Boof - the snorting, exhaling sound, often made when tracking small animals like squirrels</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="sizes">
        <h1>Doggo Sizes</h1>
            <p> Not to be missed are the all important adjective words 
                that we use to affectionately describe doggos. Pictures
                are provided for reference.
